    "My Project is a LeagueBot. This is a bot to organize data of 141 characters in the game called League of Legends. Since there are so many characters in the game, new players often get confused about the role of each characters and their classes. Therfore, I designed a chatbot that can inform users really brief information about the character. The bot can tell the user about role and classes of the specific character or the list of characters that belongs to certain role or classes. The next version's feature will be story of each characters and the list of items that each charcter usually gets for their chosen role. \n",
    "\n",
    "I tried to put good guidelines so users can use my chatbot without having troubles. Some basic functions are from the A3 ChatBot assignment but most of the functions were self written. Also imported webbrowser just so user can actually open the league of legends game webpage to see the list of characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project is done without using the class to see how python works without using the class. The code is really long with various functions but well organized for other developers to see and adapt some functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Enjoy trying the League bot!"
